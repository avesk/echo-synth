# echo-synth
This project will be using techniques in Music Information Retrieval to create a synthesizer from instrument samples. The aim is to extract oscillator and envelope data from a sample, and use the data as a seed to construct a synthesizer. Creating synthesizers in this way allows artists to create digital instruments from a naturally occuring starting point. An artist can use physical techniques from the real world to create organic sounds and combine them with digital techniques to further augment the instrument. The paper describes the technical challenges and solutions in implementing such a system. It also outlines some preliminary tests and results. The final deliverable is a sample driven synthesizer called ECHO SYNTH.
